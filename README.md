This code allows a malicious website to **detect whether the user is browsing through a proxy or not** by using image tags. Proxies are often used by corporations, political dissidents, and privacy conscience Internet users because they can provide additional security or anonymous Internet browsing.

## Here's how it works

Firefox uses square brackets `[ ]` to denote IPv6 addresses, but this notation also works to describe IPv4 addresses (I'm not sure exactly why).

So, if we embed an image with `src="http://[74.207.246.197]/pic.jpg"` into a page, Firefox automatically resolves `[74.207.246.197]` into the IP address `74.207.246.197`.

However, if the user is browsing through a proxy, this automatic resolution doesn't happen.Â Instead, Firefox asks the proxy to do a DNS lookup for the "domain" `[74.207.246.197]`, which obviously fails since it's not a valid domain name.

Most proxies don't know how to handle the bracketed domain, so the DNS lookup fails. I've tested this on [Tor](http://www.torproject.org) (popular proxy for anonymous Internet browsing), [PHP Proxy](http://sourceforge.net/projects/php-proxy/) and [CGI Proxy](http://www.jmarshall.com/tools/cgiproxy/) (the top two web-based proxies), and [Proxify](http://www.proxify.com) (popular commercial web proxy).

So, if the image fails to load, we know that the user is browsing through a proxy. Add some Javascript to detect when the image fails to load and you've got a working proxy detector.

(Works in: Firefox 3, Safari 5)

This, of course, assumes that the user is not blocking cross-domain requests. Also, my implementation requires Javascript to be enabled, but that's not a necessity.
